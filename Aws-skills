AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform used by individuals, businesses, 
and governments to access on-demand IT resources like computing power, storage, databases, and 
AI services over the internet, eliminating the need for physical data centers and allowing them to pay only for what they use, 
scaling resources as needed. It powers everything from websites and mobile apps (like Lyft) to big data analytics, machine 
learning, and IoT, offering over 200 services for building and running applications securely and reliably.
